			<h3>Will Basics</h3>
			<p>Generally speaking, a will is a legal document that coordinates the distribution of your assets after death and can appoint 
			   guardians for minor children. 
			</p>
			<h3>Dying Without a Will</h3>
			<p>Without a will, the state in which you reside decides how to distribute your assets to your beneficiaries according to its laws. 
			   This is known as dying intestate, and the resulting settlement process may not produce the results that you would prefer for your 
			   survivors. You can prevent this from happening by having documents drafted that reflect your wishes.
			</p>
			<h3>Parts of a Will</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Designation of an executor, who carries out the provisions of the will.</li>
				<li>Beneficiariesâ€”those who are inheriting the assets.</li>
				<li>Instructions for how and when the beneficiaries will receive the assets.</li>
				<li>Guardians for any minor children.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Probate</h3>
			<p>Probate is a legal process for settling an estate, whether one has a will or not.In Massachusetts, if an estate is less than $25,000, 
			   not including the value of a car, a simple process called "voluntary administration" can be used.
			</p>
			<p>Probate is also public record, so it decreases the level of privacy of the estate. Generally speaking, an asset that allows the
			   owner to name a beneficiary will not have to go through probate.
