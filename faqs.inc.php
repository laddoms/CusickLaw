		<button class="accordion"><h3>+  How do you charge legal fees?  +</h3></button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>It depends on the type of case.  For personal injury cases, I (like most attorneys) will charge on a contingent fee basis.  
			   That is, you will not pay a legal fee if we do not recover any money on the case.  The fee will be a percentage (usually one-third) 
			   of the money that is recovered, plus expenses.
			</p>
			<p>For certain types of cases, such as preparing a will or prenuptial agreement or an 
			   uncontested divorce, I will charge a flat fee.  On cases such as a contested divorce, I will charge an hourly rate.
			</p>
		</div><br /><br />
		<button class="accordion"><h3>+  Do we need to hire a lawyer if my spouse and I agree on the terms of our divorce? +</h3></button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>If you and your spouse have no children and no assets to divide, you can probably do the divorce yourselves.  
			   But otherwise, even if you agree on everything, it’s probably better to consult a lawyer.  
			</p>
			<p>One lawyer can’t represent both parties to a divorce, even if everything is agreed, but you don’t necessarily need to have two lawyers, 
			   if one person wants to represent him/herself.  
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes there are issues that people didn’t realize need to be included in the Separation Agreement—for example, do you know the 
			   difference between survival and merger?  If all the paperwork isn’t filled out properly, the judge won’t grant 
			   the divorce.  You might be able to fix the problem the same day, but you might have to go back to court on another day—it’s a lot better 
			   to have things done right the first time.
			</p>
		</div><br /><br />
		<button class="accordion"><h3>+  How does an insurance company decide how much to pay for a car accident case? +</h3></button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The amount of money you might be able to receive in a car accident case depends on many factors.  The first one is the amount of 
			   insurance coverage.  All Massachusetts drivers are required to carry insurance in the amount of $20,000 per person, $40,000 per accident, 
			   but they might have a lot more.  The insurance company can’t pay more than the coverage.  
			</p>
			<p>In determining how much a case is worth, the insurance company will also look at the amount of medical bills, loss of earning capacity 
			   and whether you had a period of total or partial disability.  The higher your expenses and the more serious your injury, the more 
			   your case is worth. 
			</p>
			<p>You are also entitled to receive money for “pain and suffering.”  The amount offered can vary a lot between cases, so it is important 
			   to hire an experienced attorney who is familiar with the value of similar cases.
			</p>
		</div><br /><br />
		<button class="accordion"><h3>+  Who will pay for my medical bills if I have an auto accident?  +</h3></button>
		<div class="panel">		
			<p>The plan for payment under the Massachusetts “no fault” law (called Personal Injury Protection under your policy) can be complicated.
			   If you have no health insurance, or if you have Medicare or MassHealth, your own auto insurance will pay up to $8,000 for your 
			   medical bills and lost wages. 
			</p>
			<p>If you do have health insurance, your auto insurance will pay the first $2,000 of medical bills.  After that, your bills will be 
			   submitted to your health insurance for payment. 
			</p>
			<p>If you have co-payments or a deductible, your auto insurance will pay, again up to the $8,000 limit.  Once the $2,000 is paid, you have 
			   to make sure that you go through the usual process that your health insurance requires to get treatment, such as getting a referral or 
			   making sure that your health care provider is covered by your insurance, otherwise the auto insurance can still refuse to pay.  
			</p>
			<p>The one exception is if the type of treatment is not covered by your health insurance at all—for example, if your health insurance 
			   doesn’t cover chiropractic treatment, you can choose any chiropractor and the auto insurance will pay for it; but if your health 
			   insurance does cover chiropractic only if you choose a certain provider, but you choose a provider who is not on the list, then you will
			   be paying out of your pocket. 
			</p>
			<p>In any event, if some of your bills are paid by your health insurance, you will usually have to pay them back from your settlement
				amount.  That’s why it’s important to get enough money to cover the health insurance lien.  If there is not enough insurance coverage, 
				we will try to get the health insurance company to reduce its lien.
