On the probate one, delete the 2nd sentence and change it to "In Massachuse=
tts, if an estate is less than $25,000, not including the value of a car, a=
 simple process called "voluntary administration" can be used."
Under deeds, change from "Itmust be filed with your county clerk or tax ass=
essor collector, must bewitnessed by a legal official and its contents must=
 be accurate. " to"=C2=A0 "It must be filed with the Registry of Deeds for =
the county that the property is located in and must be witnessed by a Notar=
y Public."
For the "homesteads" section, delete what you have and change it to this:
"A homestead is a legal document that is filed in the Registry of Deeds to =
protect the home in which you live from claims by creditors.=C2=A0 It can p=
rotect the value of real estate up to $500,000."=C2=A0 Take out the whole n=
ext section about "Property Taxes" because I don't think it applies in Mass=
.
Also, take out the whole Civil Litigation part because I don't like it.=C2=
=A0 lol
I did buy the domain name from the company that you told me to get it from =
and I think my password is salsa1957 (may have a capital S)--I use the same=
 password for everything.
I hope you have a very nice Christmas.=C2=A0 I appreciate all the work you =
have been doing and when we put it up I want to announce it on Facebook so =
people will look at it and I want to mention you as the web designer so may=
be you can get some work, if that's ok with you.
